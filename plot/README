# serialport library
Started using the https://hackage.haskell.org/package/serialport library and the experimental handle API.
It was a nice idea but it was buggy and wouldn't start reading the handle sporadically (hGetLine) under some
situations, never figured out why so I abondoned it for reading the serial as an ordinary file instead.
